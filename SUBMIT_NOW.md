## Step 3: (BONUS) Get Extra Points - Post X Thread (30 minutes)

### Option A: Quick Thread

Go to: https://twitter.com/compose/tweet

Copy-paste the first tweet from `docs/X_THREAD_TEMPLATE.md`:

```
It's 2026 and Solana UX still sucks for most users.

Why?
- Install wallet app ❌
- Write down seed phrase (never lose it!) ❌
- Buy SOL for gas fees ❌
- Click through 5 dialogs ❌

This is NOT how normal people use apps.

FaceID should work here. Let me show you how.

(with link to live demo)
```

**Then reply with thread** from template (tweets 2-8)

**Tag**: @lazorkit @superteamfun @solana

### Option B: Skip (No Bonus)

If you're tired, skip the thread. Your main submission is strong enough.
